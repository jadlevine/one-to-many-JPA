# Notes

1. implementing @ManyToOne rather than @OneToMany allows us to:

   - work with Pagination, [ref](https://bezkoder.com/spring-boot-pagination-filter-jpa-pageable/)
   - sort/order by multiple fields, [ref](https://bezkoder.com/spring-data-sort-multiple-columns/)

2. [Derived Queries](https://www.bezkoder.com/jpa-repository-query/)

3. [Custom queries with @Query](https://www.bezkoder.com/spring-jpa-query/)

4. [Unit testing for this project](https://bezkoder.com/spring-boot-unit-test-jpa-repo-datajpatest/)
